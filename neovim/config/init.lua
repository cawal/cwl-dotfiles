What is Kickstart?

  Kickstart.nvim is *not* a distribution.

  Kickstart.nvim is a starting point for your own configuration.
    The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand
    what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.

    Once you've done that, you can start exploring, configuring and tinkering to
    make Neovim your own! That might mean leaving Kickstart just the way it is for a while
    or immediately breaking it into modular pieces. It's up to you!

    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:

  TODO: The very first thing you should do is to run the command `:Tutor` in Neovim.

    If you don't know what this means, type the following:
      - <escape key>
      - :
      - Tutor
      - <enter key>

    (If you already know the Neovim basics, you can skip this step.)

  Once you've completed that, you can continue working through **AND READING** the rest
  of the kickstart init.lua.

  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

  I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
    These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
    plugins or Neovim features used in Kickstart.

   NOTE: Look for lines like this

    Throughout the file. These are for you, the reader, to help you understand what is happening.
    Feel free to delete them once you know what you're doing, but they should serve as a guide
    for when you are first encountering a few different constructs in your Neovim config.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

I hope you enjoy your Neovim journey,
- TJ

P.S. You can delete this when you're done too. It's your config now! :)

--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
require("lazy").setup({
	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
	"tpope/vim-sleuth", -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--
	--  This is equivalent to:
	--    require('Comment').setup({})

	-- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
	{ "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--
	-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
	{ -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
		"lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim",
		opts = {
			signs = {
				add = { text = "+" },
				change = { text = "~" },
				delete = { text = "_" },
				topdelete = { text = "‾" },
				changedelete = { text = "~" },
			},
		},
	},

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end

	{ -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
		"folke/which-key.nvim",
		event = "VimEnter", -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
		config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading

			-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.

			-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
			-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
			--
			-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
			-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
			-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
			-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
			--
			-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
			--  - Go to definition
			--  - Find references
			--  - Autocompletion
			--  - Symbol Search
			--  - and more!
			--
			-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
			-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
			--
			-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
			-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

			--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
			--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	require("kickstart.plugins.debug"),
	require("kickstart.plugins.indent_line"),
	require("kickstart.plugins.lint"),

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
	-- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
